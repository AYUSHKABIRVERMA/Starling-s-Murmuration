# Starling-s-Murmuration
Few things in nature is as impressive as how some animals seems to be able to organize themselves
into larger groups so effortlessly.Starlings are small passerine birds in the family Sturnidae.As
starlings gather in the evenings to roost, often they will participate in what is called a murmuration
— a huge flock that shape-shifts in the sky as if it were one swirling liquid mass. Often the behavior
is sparked by the presence of a predator like a hawk or peregrine falcon, and the flock’s movement
is based on evasive maneuvers. There is safety in numbers, so the individual starlings do not
scatter but rather are able to move as an intelligent cloud, feinting away from a diving raptor,
thousands of birds changing direction almost simultaneously. One of the first stepping stones to
get to an understanding of flocking behaviour is to be able to simulate it.The first flocking-behavior
simulation was done on a computer by Craig Reynolds in 1986 he called his simulation program:
“Boids”. It’s still to this day to most used model for simulating flocking behaviour. This project
consists of a world of BOIDS, each having its own intelligence to control its movement. Each BOID
is capable of deciding its own path to take depending on where the rest of the flock is and how
bunched up its neighbors are.
